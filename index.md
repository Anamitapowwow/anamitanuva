<hr />

<p> In myself, I see a passion for finance, economics, technology, development, and creativity. Having various working experiences as a student and professional, I aspire to challenge myself to develop at my full potential.

<p> Avid traveller. Explorer. Painting and Desigining. Love trying out new food but never good with experimenting. </p>

<p> I received my bachelors of Science in Economics from Arizona State University in 2019. Being born and raised in Bangladesh, Economics as a topic interested me as I liked the real world implications of the various concepts and policies taught at my home school. Studying and working in the States made me realize the importance of technology in todays day and age. Hence, having a certification in Business Analytics, I am continuing my journey in learning the basics of programming and strengthening my skills in data visualization applications. </p>
